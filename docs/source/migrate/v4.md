# Migrating to Version 4

With the introduction of 4.0 we had to change our package type to `module` due to some new dependencies.
This will likely cause a lot of issues with any project not configured to act as a `module` and instead use `commonjs`.

In these cases we recommend you move `bnf-parser` to a dev dependency before upgrading.
Once you've installed the new version follow the [CLI tutorial](/cli) and onwards to use generated artifacts instead of directly interfacing with the library.

The 4.0 release of the library is not intended to be used directly as a library, but instead as more of a `CLI` tool for compiling your bnfs down to an optimised parser with type definitions.
