# BNF Parser

!!! warning "Migrating from v3.0"

    If you are looking for the documentation for the older version of the api go [here](/legacy)  
    Overwise if you are attempting to migrate from `3.0`->`4.0` we recommend reading this [migration guide](/migrate/v4)

!!! note "Built to not be a dependency"

    If you use the included cli tool to generate your syntax parser you don't need to include this library as your dependency, you can just import those artifacts.

[![Reflection Test](https://github.com/AjaniBilby/BNF-parser/actions/workflows/npm-load-check.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/AjaniBilby/BNF-parser/actions/workflows/npm-load-check.yml)

Compile your bnfs down to WebAssembly for maximum parsing speed; with generated type definitions to make using the syntax tree outputs a breeze. The compiled output from this library is platform agnostic, so it can run anywhere `new WebAssembly.Instance()` is a valid function. It bundles the WebAssembly module inside of a single js file so it can be easily incorporated into any bundler. The type definitions for a given bnf are just that, a definitions file - so if you don't want to use typescript or type hints you can go wild by ignoring it.

```bnf title="BNF"
program ::= chunk+ ;
chunk ::= "a"+ "b"+ ;
```
```ts title="Typescript"
import * as syntax from "./bnf/example.js";

const tree  /*(1)!*/ = syntax.Parse_Program("abbaabab").root;
const block /*(2)!*/ = program.value[0];
const firstBs   = program.value[1];
const bCount: number = firstBs.value.length; // (3)!
```

1. Inferred type `Term_Program`
2. Inferred type `Term_Chunk`
3. No Errors Here! Typescript knows this will be a `number` thanks to the type definitions generated by `bnf-parser` for the bnf
