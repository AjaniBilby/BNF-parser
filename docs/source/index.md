# BNF Parser

!!! danger "Pre-Release Warning"

    This documentation is for the 4.0 version of `bnf-parser` which is still in pre-release  
    For documentation for the current legacy version please go [here](/legacy)

!!! note "Built to not be a dependency"

    If you use the included cli tool to generate your syntax parser you don't need to include this library as your dependency, you can just import those artifacts.

[![Reflection Test](https://github.com/AjaniBilby/BNF-parser/actions/workflows/npm-load-check.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/AjaniBilby/BNF-parser/actions/workflows/npm-load-check.yml)

Compile your bnfs down to WebAssembly for maximum parsing speed; with generated type definitions to make using the syntax tree outputs a breeze. The compiled output from this library is platform agnostic, so it can run anywhere `new WebAssembly.Instance()` is a valid function. It bundles the WebAssembly module inside of a single js file so it can be easily incorporated into any bundler. The type definitions for a given bnf are just that, a definitions file - so if you don't want to use typescript or type hints you can go wild by ignoring it.

```bnf title="BNF"
program ::= %w* statement+ ;
block   ::= %("block" w+) ...name %(w* "{" w*) seq_stmt* %("}" w*) ;
```
```ts title="Typescript"
import * as syntax from "./bnf/example.js";

const tree  /*(1)!*/    = syntax.Parse_Program(input).root;
const block /*(2)!*/    = program.value[0];
const name: string = block.value[0]; // (3)!
```

1. Inferred type `Term_Program`
2. Inferred type `Term_Statement`
3. No Errors Here! Typescript knows this will be a `string` thanks to the type definitions generated by `bnf-parser` for the bnf
