# API

!!! warning

    It is highly recommended to not directly use the APIs unless necessary,
    and instead rely on [artifacts](/artifact) generated by the CLI

    Using the API can cause a lot of confusion for non-maintainers such as some functions
    throwing `ParseError` which is a shared class between `legacy` and new code,
    but some other's actually using `_shared.ParseError` however it will appear under the same name.

    This is due to some components of this library being fundamental core components, and others are actually
    compiled by the library itself and using these [artifacts](/artifact) as part of itself in a bootstrapping process.

    Hence there are multiple versions of some types

- [`_shared`](/api/shared)
- [`bnf`](/api/bnf)
- [`legacy`](/legacy/api)
- [`wasm`](/wasm)
