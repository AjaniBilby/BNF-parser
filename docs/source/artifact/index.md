# Artifacts

After using the CLI to build your artifacts you will see for every bnf file in that folder two files will be generated. `{name}.js` which includes all of the runtime required code specific to this parser, and a `{name}.d.ts`. If you include the `.js` file, typescript will automatically read from the `d.ts` for you to find out the type structure of your syntax tree.

You will also notice a `shared.d.ts` and a `shared.js`, this is a small artifact which is shared between all bnf parsers generated to help unify certain types such as `ParseError`. All of the generated `.d.ts` and `.js` must remain in the same folder as each-other, however you can now move them as __a group__ anywhere.

Anything generated by the cli will be referred to as an `artifact` to differentiate them from any component of the `bnf-parser` library itself.
